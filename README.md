This is a University project in which we have analysed Car Emissions and Economy with a given dataset from Kaggle.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/car-fuel-emissions

## Conducted Operations
- Data filtering 
  - outliers detection
  - incorrect data detection
- Presentation of the CO2 emissions for all cars
- Comparison of Fuel Consumption for different car engine sizes and fuel types
- Presentation of the outlier and incorrect data
- Dimensionality reduction to 2D (PCA)
- KNN Clusterization
- Classification (Naive Bayes and KNN)
- Confusion Matrix
  
## System Requirements
- `MATLAB_R2020b`
